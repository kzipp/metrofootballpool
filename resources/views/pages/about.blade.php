<p>The Metro Football Pool began during the 2007 NFL season. Rising from the ashes of our Nationâ€™s economic decline like a golden phoenix with diamond&nbsp;talons, the Metro Football Pool has doubled in size since its inception.&nbsp;Our pool has received numerous accolades from fictitious organizations including the title of&nbsp;<strong><em>The Greatest Pool to Ever Exist</em></strong> by the National Pool Raters Association. Although some may say the Metro Football Pool is a copy cat of an affiliate pool, we view it as more of an important evolutionary step. Through utilizing technological advances, good looks, popularity,&nbsp;and sheer geniusness we will continue to innovate the pool and make it even more accessible&nbsp;and user friendly to our participants. This is our only promise.</p>
