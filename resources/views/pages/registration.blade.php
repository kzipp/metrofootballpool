<p>Why <a class="wp-caption-text" title="Register" href="http://www.metrofootballpool.com/wp-login.php?action=register" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Register</a>? Come to find out, you really donâ€™t need to. However, if you wanna post any comments to the <a title="Home" href="http://www.metrofootballpool.com/" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home</a> page you need to have an account that you are logged into.</p>
<p>Once you Register (should you so choose):</p>
<ol>
<li>You will receive a confirmation email with a password (so please supply your correct email address).</li>
<li>If you have trouble typing in the weird password you receive, just cut and paste it.</li>
<li>When you log on, you will have a personalized dashboard page which includes the ability&nbsp;to change your password to something more un-Rain Man-like. There are also a bunch of other features and options you can play with. Charlie Babbitt.</li>
<li>You can then just navigate back to our <a title="Home" href="http://www.metrofootballpool.com/" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">site</a> and you will be logged in and ready to rock. You can do so by clicking the link at the very&nbsp;top&nbsp;left corner of your page where it says: <strong>Metro Football Pool.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Also, every great website needs a picture of Tom Cruise. Charlie Babbitt.</p>
